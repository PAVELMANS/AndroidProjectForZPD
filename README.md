# ZPD Project - Android Application "Formulu palīgs"
The ZPD (Zinātniski Pētnieciskais darbs) project of Pavels Ivanovs and Anitra Bienāre, at the moment of working on this project, students of grade 11 in Riga State Gymnasium No.1.

The project itself is an Android application. The idea of the application is that it would serve as a tool to find formulas in such subject as Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry. The application is written in Java and developed in the Android Studio IDE. Apart from Java, formules themselves are written in HTML files and with the help of JavaScript framework formulas are displayed in a proper just-like-in-a-real-formula-book way.

The coding was done by Pavels Ivanovs whereas Anitra Beināre was responsible for the theoretical part of ZPD (writing abstract, conclusions, etc.)
